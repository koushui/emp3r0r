## üöÄ Quick Start

Get emp3r0r running in minutes with our streamlined installation and setup process.

### Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/refs/heads/v3/install.sh | bash
```

### 3-Step Setup

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server

```bash
emp3r0r server --c2-hosts 'your.domain.com' --port 12345 --operators 2
```

This command initiates emp3r0r with:

- HTTP2/TLS agent listener on random port with valid hostname in TLS certificate
- WireGuard operator service on specified port (12345)
- Operator mTLS server on `wg_ip:12346`
- Pre-registered operator slots (2 in this example)

The server displays:

1. **WireGuard Server Configuration** - server IP, port, and public key
2. **WireGuard Operator Configurations** - each operator's credentials
3. **Client Connection Commands** - ready-to-use commands

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect as Operator

Copy the generated connection command and replace `<C2_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's IP:

```bash
emp3r0r client --c2-port 12345 --server-wg-key 'key...' --c2-host your.domain.com
```

**Connection Process:**

- Each operator receives a unique, pre-configured connection command
- For local testing: use `127.0.0.1` as the C2 host
- For remote connections: replace `<C2_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's public IP or domain
- System prompts for operator's private key (displayed in server configuration)
- WireGuard connectivity is automatically configured

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Agent Payloads

Use the `generate` command from within the emp3r0r shell interface.

## üí° What is emp3r0r?

emp3r0r is a comprehensive post-exploitation framework that stands out as one of the first C2 frameworks purpose-built for Linux environments while providing seamless Windows integration. Originally developed as a research project for implementing Linux adversary techniques, it has evolved into a robust framework addressing the need for advanced post-exploitation capabilities.

### Key Differentiators

- **Linux-First Design**: Purpose-built for Linux targets with extensive Windows support
- **Extensible Architecture**: Complete Python3 support via the `vaccine` module (15MB) including Impacket, Requests, and MySQL
- **Diverse Module Support**: Bash, PowerShell, Python, DLL, SO, and EXE modules
- **Advanced Evasion**: Dynamic process obfuscation and file concealment capabilities
