## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/refs/heads/v3/install.sh | bash
```

### Quick Start Workflow

1. **Start the Server:**

   ```shell
   emp3r0r server --c2-hosts 'your.domain.com' --port 12345 --operators 2
   ```

2. **Copy Operator Command:**

   - The server displays pre-configured connection commands for each operator
   - Copy the command for your desired operator ID
   - Replace `<C2_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's public IP or domain

3. **Connect as Operator:**

   ```shell
   # Example: paste the copied command with your IP/domain
   emp3r0r client --c2-port 12345 --server-wg-key 'key...' --server-wg-ip 'ip...' --operator-wg-ip 'ip...' --c2-host your.domain.com
   ```

4. **Generate Agent Payloads:**
   - Use the `generate` command from within the emp3r0r shell interface

### Server Configuration

```shell
emp3r0r server --c2-hosts '192.168.200.3' --port 12345 --operators 3
```

This command initiates emp3r0r with:

- HTTP2/TLS agent listener on a random port, with valid hostname `192.168.200.3` in TLS server certificate
- WireGuard operator service on port `12345`
- Operator mTLS server on `wg_ip:12346` (operators share the same certificate, but have different WireGuard profiles)
- 3 pre-registered operator slots

The server will display:

1. **WireGuard Server Configuration** - showing server IP, port, and public key
2. **WireGuard Operator Configurations** - showing each operator's IP, private key, and public key
3. **Client Connection Commands** - ready-to-use commands for each operator

### Operator Connection

After starting the server, it will display a table of pre-configured client connection commands for each operator. Simply copy the appropriate command and replace `<C2_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's public IP address or domain:

```shell
# Example command (replace <C2_PUBLIC_IP> with your server's IP/domain)
emp3r0r client --c2-port 12345 --server-wg-key 'generated_key' --server-wg-ip 'wg_server_ip' --operator-wg-ip 'operator_ip' --c2-host <C2_PUBLIC_IP>
```

**Connection Process:**

- Each operator receives a unique, pre-configured connection command
- For local testing, use `127.0.0.1` as the C2 host
- For remote connections, replace `<C2_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's public IP or domain
- The system will prompt for the operator's private key (displayed in the server configuration table)
- WireGuard connectivity is automatically configured using the embedded parameters

### Agent Payload Generation

Use the `generate` command from within the emp3r0r shell interface.

## Important Notes

- Breaking changes are typically documented in release logs. Cross-version compatibility is not guaranteed due to ongoing feature development and bug fixes.
- If you encounter issues, try removing `~/.emp3r0r` directory and starting fresh.
- The wiki may not reflect all features in `v3`. Refer to command-line help for the most current information. Community contributions to the wiki are welcome.
- **Connection Issues**: If the operator connection stalls after entering the private key, verify that:
  - The C2 host IP/domain is correct and reachable
  - The WireGuard keys and IPs match exactly as displayed by the server
  - Firewall rules allow traffic on the specified WireGuard port

## Project Background

emp3r0r was initially developed as a research project for implementing Linux adversary techniques alongside original ideas. It has evolved into a comprehensive framework addressing the need for advanced post-exploitation capabilities specifically targeting Linux environments.

**What distinguishes emp3r0r** is its position as one of the first C2 frameworks purpose-built for Linux targets while providing seamless integration with external tools. The comprehensive [feature list](#features) demonstrates its versatility.

For extensibility, emp3r0r offers complete [python3 support](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Write-modules-for-emp3r0r#python) via the [`vaccine`](./core/modules/vaccine) module (15MB total), including essential packages like `Impacket`, `Requests`, and `MySQL`. The framework supports diverse module formats including `bash`, `powershell`, `python`, `dll`, `so`, and `exe`.
