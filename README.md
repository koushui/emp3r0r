## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/refs/heads/v3/install.sh | bash
```

### Server Configuration

```shell
emp3r0r server --c2-hosts '192.168.200.3' --port 12345 --operators 3
```

This command initiates emp3r0r with:

- HTTP2/TLS agent listener on a random port, with valid hostname `192.168.200.3` in TLS server certificate
- WireGuard operator service on port `12345`
- Operator mTLS server on `wg_ip:12346` (operators share the same certificate, but have different WireGuard profiles)
- 3 pre-registered operator slots

The server will display all necessary configuration details for operator setup.

### Operator Connection

```shell
emp3r0r client --c2-host '192.168.200.3' --c2-port 12345 --server-wg-ip 'C2 Server IP (WG)' --server-wg-key 'C2 Public Key' --operator-wg-ip 'IP ADDRESS'
```

This command:

- Establishes a connection between the emp3r0r operator and the remote server at `192.168.200.3:12345`
- Configures WireGuard connectivity between operator and server using the parameters provided in server output
- Supports multiple operators (each requiring unique WireGuard profiles)
- Note: If connection stalls after entering the operator's private key, verify that keys/IPs match correctly

### Agent Payload Generation

Use the `generate` command from within the emp3r0r shell interface.

## Important Notes

- Breaking changes are typically documented in release logs. Cross-version compatibility is not guaranteed due to ongoing feature development and bug fixes.
- If you encounter issues, try removing `~/.emp3r0r` directory and starting fresh.
- The wiki may not reflect all features in `v3`. Refer to command-line help for the most current information. Community contributions to the wiki are welcome.

## Project Background

emp3r0r was initially developed as a research project for implementing Linux adversary techniques alongside original ideas. It has evolved into a comprehensive framework addressing the need for advanced post-exploitation capabilities specifically targeting Linux environments.

**What distinguishes emp3r0r** is its position as one of the first C2 frameworks purpose-built for Linux targets while providing seamless integration with external tools. The comprehensive [feature list](#features) demonstrates its versatility.

For extensibility, emp3r0r offers complete [python3 support](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Write-modules-for-emp3r0r#python) via the [`vaccine`](./core/modules/vaccine) module (15MB total), including essential packages like `Impacket`, `Requests`, and `MySQL`. The framework supports diverse module formats including `bash`, `powershell`, `python`, `dll`, `so`, and `exe`.

While emp3r0r is primarily designed as a single-operator framework, the SSH C2-Relay feature enables separation between C2 server and operator functions.
